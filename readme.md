## Running the App ##
***Please contact Howard if you would like access to this repo.***

1. Unzip the package containing the app directory
2. Open your terminal and `cd` into the app directory (`/git-food`) and make sure you have `pip` installed
3. Activate the virtual env by executing this line in the terminal: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Ensure the virtual environment is properly set up by executing: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Set the following FIVE environment variables by executing in terminal:
```
export FLASK_APP=gitfood.py
export DB_URI=postgresql://git_food_user:uelFgIGe9GCTYYttir2XHNJ9Y4auBX4G@dpg-clrqa1cm7d1c73f483tg-a.ohio-postgres.render.com/git_food
export SEC_KEY=uelFgIGe9GCTYYttir2XHNJ9Y4auBX4G
export CLIENT_SECRET=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
export CALLBACK_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5553/callback
```
5. Execute a local instance of the app: `python gitfood.py` (may need to use `python3` instead of `python`)
6. Navigate to the URL outputted to terminal which should look something like this: `http://127.0.0.1:5553` (if there is a error with the port, you can change it in the `gitfood.py` in the main directory)
7. Login with your Google account and explore the website.

***Disclaimer: The app will be run in develpoment mode, so any errors not caught by our app will show as the error stack trace generated by Flask in the window instead.***

## Hosting Online ##
Both the app and the database are hosted online using **Render**. The database is still accessible from a local instance of the app. The website, which can be found [here](https://www.gitfood.onrender.com/), is not fully functional due to our authentication implementation. In order to make authentication possible on `localhost`, the Google OAuth2 credentials must include a redirect URI to `http://127.0.0.1:5333/callback`, but this causes issues for when the app is hosted online because of redirect URI mismatches.

## Tech Stack ##
- Python
- Jinja2
- Flask (Flask-SqlAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-Migrate)
- Google OAuth2
- PostgreSQL
- HTML, CSS
- Javascript, jQuery/AJAX
